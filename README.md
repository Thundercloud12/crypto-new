# üìà Real-Time Cryptocurrency Dashboard

A real-time cryptocurrency dashboard built with React and WebSockets, featuring live price updates, sparklines, and pagination. This application provides an interactive interface to monitor cryptocurrency prices in real-time.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript)
* **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI
* **Data Visualization**: react-sparklines
* **Real-Time Data**: WebSocket connections to Binance API
* **Pagination**: Client-side pagination([GitHub][1])

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

### Frontend

* **React Components**: Modular components for UI elements like search bar, filters, and cryptocurrency cards.
* **Redux Store**: Manages application state, including cryptocurrency data and WebSocket connections.
* **WebSocket Integration**: Establishes a single WebSocket connection to Binance's API to receive live trade data.
* **Data Buffers**: Maintains a buffer of recent price points for each cryptocurrency to render sparklines.
* **Pagination**: Displays a fixed number of cryptocurrencies per page with navigation controls.

## üì¶ Deployment

### Vercel

This application can be easily deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. **Push your code to a Git repository** (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

2. **Import your project into Vercel**:

   * Log in to Vercel and click on "New Project".
   * Select your repository and follow the prompts.

3. **Configure build settings**:

   * **Framework**: React
   * **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   * **Output Directory**: `build`([Wasp][2])

4. **Set Environment Variables** (if any):

   * Add any necessary environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings" > "Environment Variables".

5. **Deploy**:

   * Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process.

### Note on WebSockets

Vercel's serverless functions do not support persistent WebSocket connections. However, since this application establishes WebSocket connections from the client-side directly to Binance's API, it functions correctly on Vercel without any issues.
